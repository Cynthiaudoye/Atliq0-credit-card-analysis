## Aim

This project aims to conduct a thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) of AtliQ0 Bank Credit Card data from the provided source (MySQL, CSV & Excel). The main objectives of this analysis are:

1. **Data Preparation and Cleaning**: Load and clean the data to ensure it is suitable for analysis. This includes handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting data types where necessary.

2. **Data Visualization**: Visualize the distribution to identify key patterns and trends. Each visualization is accompanied by a brief commentary summarizing the observations.

3. **Statistical Analysis**: Explore the relationships. This involves creating scatter plots and correlation matrices to examine statistics across different ages.

4. **Hypothesis Testing**: Conduct statistical tests, specifically T-Tests, to compare the percentages. This includes a detailed explanation of the results and interpretation of p-values to understand if the differences observed are statistically significant.

The final deliverable is a Jupyter Notebook that provides both the code and a detailed discussion of the findings. The notebook is also converted into a PDF format for ease of distribution and presentation.
